									<h3 class="major">About me</h3>
									<p>As someone who once studied biology in high school, I never could have imagined that I would one day be fully immersed in the field of data analysis and machine learning. But what started as a curious search on the web has become a true passion that drives me to explore new opportunities and push myself to new heights.

										My journey has been one of persistent curiosity and unwavering determination. When I first became interested in engineering, I didn't let the fact that I had studied biology in high school hold me back. Instead, I followed my passion and pursued a college degree in engineering, even though it meant leaving behind what was familiar and comfortable.
										
										Later, when I stumbled upon the world of data analysis and machine learning, I knew I had found my true calling. Despite the challenges of learning a new field and mastering complex concepts, my passion for this work has kept me driven and focused.</p>

									<p>What I have learned through this journey is that there is no substitute for following your passion and pursuing your dreams. It takes courage to make a dynamic shift in your education and professional pursuits, but the rewards are immeasurable. For me, the joy and satisfaction of exploring the limitless potential of data analysis and machine learning make all the hard work and challenges worthwhile.

										So if you too are considering a shift in your academic or professional pursuits, I urge you to follow your passion with persistence and determination. Embrace the challenges, push past the obstacles, and never stop learning and growing. Who knows where your journey may lead you?</p>
