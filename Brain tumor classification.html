									<h2 class="major">About project and objective:</h2>
									<p>The Objective of this study is to Classify the kind of tumor present in the brain using the MRI images took from the patients. 
										For this image classification I am using different models in CNN architectures. By this study classifing the tumor 
										in brain becomes lot easier without the human intervention. The future scope of this study may go to monitoring the
										 tumor size for specific patient and anaysing the medicines impact whether its working or Not, is it slowing the tumor 
										 cells growth or not. By models like this Implementing in medical field improves the overall health of the humans significantly..</p>

									<h2>dataset description:</h2>
									<p>This Dataset contains images of MRI scans of 3 different types of Brain tumors and images of no brain tumor. Totally 
										3264 images containing three different classes of tumors stated as glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, 
										pituitary tumor. And labelled classes in images follows.</p>

									<p>Labelled Classes of images:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Glioma tumor</li>
										<li>Meningioma tumor</li>
										<li>Pituitary tumor</li>
										<li>No tumor</li>
									</ul>
									<h2 class="major"></h2>
									<h2>short note about all tumors:</h2>
									<article>
										<h3>glioma tumor</h3>
										<p>glioma is a tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord. There are several types, 
											including astrocytomas, ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas. Gliomas can affect children 
											or adults. Some grow very quickly. Most people with gliomas need a combination of 
											treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</p>
									</article>
									<article>
										<h2 class="major"></h2>
										<h3>meningioma tumor</h3>
										<p>A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges â€” the membranes 
											that surround the brain and spinal cord. Although not technically a brain tumor, 
											it is included in this category because it may compress or squeeze the adjacent brain, 
											nerves and vessels. Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head.</p>
									</article>
									<article>
										<h2 class="major"></h2>
										<h3>pituitary tumor</h3>
										<p>Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in your pituitary gland. Some pituitary 
											tumors result in too much of the hormones that regulate important functions of your body. Some 
											pituitary tumors can cause your pituitary gland to produce lower levels of hormones.
											</p>

									<h2>image splitting and image augumentation:</h2>
									<P>out of 3264 images, 2870 images are used for training purpose of models. from 2870 images took for 
										training, again 574 images are used as validation of the models.</P>
									<p>the images are standardly scaled in 256/256 pixels. to avoid overfitting and work best towards 
										unseen image, image augumentation is done. the images are randomly fliped horizontally and vertically 
										then they are randomly rotated sideways.</p>

									<h2 class="major"></h2>
									<h3>model 1:</h3>
									<p>In first model i have built an architecture that i have seen on online and experimented with it, this contains 
										sequencial layers of 2 con2D layers with kernal size of 3,3 and maxpooling layer below each. After that flatten 
										is used to flatout. Now 3 dense layer of 32, 16, 8 consecutively, with "relu" activation layer. lastly the final 
										layer of "softmax" for output. the adam optimiser is used for optimisation of the accuracy metric. And used 'reducedLRonplateau' to reduce the laering 
										rate when there is no improvement in validation loss.</p>
									<h4 class="image-title">Model Summary</h4>
									<img src="images/model 1.jpeg" width="700" height="500" align="center">
									<h4>results:</h4>
									<li>Accuracy on the train images: 91.68%</li>
									<li>Accuracy on validation images: 87.11%</li>
									<p>Using this model to predict test image i got 232 images correctly classified, 
										162 wrongly classified out of 394 total images.</p>
									<h2 class="major"></h2>
									<h3>model 2:</h3>
									<p>EfficientnetB0 is what used to build 2nd model. This function has Keras image classification model, optionally 
										loaded with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. i chose this because seen online some people using this pre trained 
										model to work with this image data and gave good results too.After efficientnetV2B0 in the sequence, used 
										GlobalAveragepooling, dropout of 0.5, dense layer of 8 nodes with "relu", and finally dense layer with the 
										softmax layer of 4 classes. here also,the adam optimiser is used for optimisation of the accuracy metric. And used 'reducedLRonplateau' to reduce the laering 
										rate when there is no improvement in validation loss. in addition to that early stop also used to maintain lower loss.</p>
									<h4 class="image-title">Model Summary</h4>
									<img src="images/model 2.jpeg" width="500" height="350" align="center">
									<h4>results:</h4>
									<li>Accuracy on the train images: 99.96%</li>
									<li>Accuracy on validation images: 97.04%</li>
									<p>Using this model to predict test image i got 303 images correctly classified, 
										91 wrongly classified out of 394 total images.</p>
									<h2 class="major"></h2>
									<h3>model 3:</h3>
									<p>After seen the results of EfficientnetB0 i am soo curious to try the other EfficientNet versions so i went with 
										EfficientNet version 2 B0. This also weights pre-trained on ImageNet and also with bigger size. In the sequence 
										after efficientnetV2B0 used GlobalAveragepooling, dropout of 0.5, dense layer of 8 nodes with "relu", and finally 
										the softmax layer of no of classes.here also,the adam optimiser is used for optimisation of the accuracy metric. And used 'reducedLRonplateau' to reduce the laering 
										rate when there is no improvement in validation loss. in addition to that early stop also used to maintain lower loss.</p>
									<h4 class="image-title">Model Summary</h4>
									<img src="images/model 3.jpeg" width="500" height="350" align="center">
									<h4>results:</h4>
									<li>Accuracy on the train images: 99.52%</li>
									<li>Accuracy on validation images: 96.17%</li>
									<p>Using this model to predict test image i got 283 images correctly classified, 111 wrongly classified out of 394 total 
										images. less than the Efficientnet Version 1.</p>

									
									<h4 class="major"></h4>
									<h2>applying test set images:</h2>
									<li>Model 1 predicted</li>
									<p>232 images correct and 162 incorrect out of 394.</p>
									<li>With model 2 got upto</li>
									<p>303 images correct and 91 incorrect out of 394.</p>
									<li>On model 3</li>
									<p>283 images correct and 111 incorrect out of 394.</p>
									<h1 class="major"></h1>

									
									<h2>Recommended model:</h2>
										<p>Second model, EfficientNetB0 model gives better Accuracy and cross val accuracy score. So for now second model bestfits 
											for this image data. And also while running the test image set on the second "efficientnetB0" model provides precise 
											classification much better then any other two models, correctly classifies upto 303 classes out of 394 better then other 
											232 and 283. Since classification is the main objective i choose this second model as successor.</p>
									<h2 class="major"></h2>
									<h2>Insights:</h2>
										<p>while testing the models, all of them have some difficulties to classify between "no tumor" and "Glioma tumor" and 
											"pituitary tumor" this may be because of the location of the tumor in the brain.
											
											In further, as always more images will help to get more accurate classification. And exploring the pre trained models 
											more will improve results in long run.
											
											since building own model requires more trail and error, it also not an Bad option.</p>
